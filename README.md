# SPSA-Simulation-Project

This is the archive of the group project for the assignment in course "Simulation Methods for Optimization and Learning" in the Peking University Globex Julmester Program (2023).

The goal of this project was to find the optimal investment strategy to maximize total returns using the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation Algorithm (SPSA). 

### Contributions
- The **code** of the project was developed and implemented by me, [Zeng Shaoyu](https://github.com/Carbonadooo).
- The **report** was collaboratively written by me and my teammates:
  - Chen Xi
  - Gu Qinglong
  - Wu Zhangyi
  - Ying Longwei

I was responsible for the following sections of the report:
- Description of the Optimization Approach
- Description of the Program
- Validation and Verification

  
**Note**: This repository is an archive of the project completed in July 2023 and does not serve as an active version control system.
